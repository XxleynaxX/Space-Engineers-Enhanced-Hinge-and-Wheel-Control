# Space Engineers Enhanced Hinge and Wheel Control
 Description of the Script  This script controls a hinge and wheels (suspension) in a Space Engineers grid based on the player's input from a control seat. It allows the player to move the hinge left or right using the "A" and "D" keys, move the wheels forward or backward using the "W" and "S" keys, and activate the handbrake using the "P" key.
